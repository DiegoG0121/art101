            <p>Within this lab we are asked to be capable of using functions, these functions have commands to follow. They could also contain parameters.</p>

            <h2 class="headerFont">Reflection:</h2>
            <p>I have had past experience in programming, but it wasn't the same language, it was fun to learn a new language that I have never learned. The syntax, and there method calling. I beleive I put in a good amount of effort into this lab.</p>
