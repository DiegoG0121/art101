	Pseudocode for Game - Laundry
					//Initialize 108 card deck stack
					//For every 25 cards switch color (Red Green Yellow Blue)
					// 1: ‘0’ card , 2 of each: ‘1-9’ cards, 2:skips, 2: draw+2, 2:reverses
					//The remaining 8 cards are 4: +4’s & 4: wilds
						//0&1-9 cards g(0-9)=green card number
						//y!2 = yellow + 2 card
					//Shuffle deck (Randomize elements)
					//Designate a discard pile(stack) which holds nothing now.
					//create player hands(dynamic arrays)
					//define function "dealcard" for needed mechanic
						//popdeckstack, store in player hand
					//Start game
						//popdeckstack to get top card then move it to the discard stack
						//call dealcard 7 times - starting hand is 7 cards for each player/bot
					//Player turn/validation
						// display the card to the players
						// display the player’s hand
						//game must validate a card can be played and will return the card to the player’s turn if invalid.
							//+4 and wild cards can be placed at any time
							//after being played input is required to tell the next color for the discard pile.
								// ex: g5 is a green 5 players must play a wild or g() card.
						// if a player cannot play a card, they will have to draw a card to end their turn.
						// once validated, turn is handed to next player/bot
					//Game End Scenarios
						//Once a player has two cards in hand
						//the player must type UNO into the console before playing a card or else they must draw another card.
						//if the deck empties, take all but the top card from the discard stack, randomize and add to deck stack.
						//Having an empty hand results in a victory
	
	
	Pseudocode for Everyday Task - Laundry
					//Separate clothing into 2 categories, light & dark.
					//Light colors will go in one load the dark colors in the other.
						//Start with the dark colors, and put them in the washing machine.
						//throw a tide pod in there, open the tray on the side and put in your detergent/softener.
						//set it to cold since you're doing dark colors.
						//turn on the washing machine.
					//Light colors follow the same steps except it is set to warm.
					//once the washing machine is done throw it all in the dryer.
					//throw in 1-2 dryer sheets, clean out the lint trap and turn it on.
					//once the dryer is done your laundry is clean and dry you're welcome.

	Pseudocode for Everyday Task - Microwave
					//open the microwave door
						//owner puts something in the microwave door
						//if the door is still open
							//owner can’t use the microwave
						//else if closed
							//owner can use the microwave
					//owner chooses whether a button
						//if button has a set time
							//time sets with its default
						// else if button is a number
							//place within area
							//take user back to choose a button
							//till user has pressed start
					//timer
						//if timer is 0:00
							//owner can open door and take item
						//else if timer is interrupted
							//then owner can open and take item
						//continue
